### Project Management

The Kanban Boards feature of Github Projects was used as the project management tool during the production of this website. User stories were assigned two labels, one an EPIC label, and the second using the MoSCoW prioritisation technique.

EPICS were defined as User Accounts, Shop Browsing, Checkout & Bag, Site Admin and Blog. User Stories were then generated and designated as Must Have, Should Have, Could Have and Won't Have.

Must Have User stories were prioritised for completion first, and these were all implemented by project end. Once completed, tasks were moved to the Done pile. 

You can view the [Kanban Boards](https://github.com/Chris-McGonigle/island-flowers/projects/1?fullscreen=true) to see the project progress. Unfinished tasks would be aimed to be completed in future iterations.

## Deployment

Local deployment was carried out using the Command Line Interface. to enable this the following steps were carried out:

1. Create a repository on GitHub.
2. Clone the repository on your chosen source code editor (GitPod) using the clone link.
3. Open the terminal within GitPod
4. Enter "python3 manage.py runserver into the terminal.
5. Go to local host address on my web browser.
6. All locally saved changes will show up here.

For the final deployment to Heroku, the following was carried out:

1. Uncomment the PostgreSQL databse from settings.py file.
2. Set debug = False in settings.py file.
3. Commit and push all files to GitHub
4. In Heroku, remove the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC config var.
5. In the deploy tab, go to the manual deploy sections and click deploy branch.

## Credits

1. The code for the home page carousel was taken from the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/) and amended for this project. I also used tutorials on [easyhtml5video.com](https://easyhtml5video.com/articles/bootstrap-carousel-image-680.html) to help in getting the images to display correctly.
